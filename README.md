Global Pollution Classification Project


In summary, the project successfully applied machine learning for the classification of global regions into High or Low Pollution Zones by considering pollution indicators such as CO₂, SO₂, and particulate matter. Following data preparation and exploratory analysis, logistic and decision tree classifiers were trained, with the decision tree achieving the greatest accuracy of 89%. Primary insights concluded that consistently high CO₂ and SO₂ levels in certain regions were strongly associated with their classification as High Pollution. Hence, in a global environmental context, it is recommended that policymakers should focus on curtailing industrial emissions in high-risk zones and promoting clean energy efforts. In addition, pollution levels should be monitored continuously, with forecast modeling based on data so as to identify potential interventions and mitigate future adverse environmental impacts.
