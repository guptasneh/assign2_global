Global Pollution Classification Project


In this project, we explored the classification of global regions into high or low pollution zones using machine learning models based on environmental data such as CO₂, SO₂, and NO₂ levels. After preprocessing the dataset and applying three classification algorithms—Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Decision Tree—we evaluated their performances using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score. Among the models tested, the Decision Tree Classifier delivered the best results, achieving 100% accuracy, indicating it was able to perfectly distinguish between high and low pollution zones on the test data. In contrast, both Naive Bayes and KNN achieved an accuracy of approximately 56%, struggling with class misclassification. These findings suggest that Decision Trees are highly effective for this type of environmental classification problem. For future work, we recommend validating the model with cross-validation techniques, testing it on larger and more diverse datasets, and integrating additional real-time pollution data sources to enhance model robustness and reliability.
